<h3>Gowtham GM</h3>
<p>A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.<br>
    I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student.
     I joined Tap<br> Academy as a CSR student in the month of February.
      My journey with Tap<br> Academy is quite different. The trainers at
       Tap Academy are skilled and <br>experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning<br> programming languages from scratch.<br>
    
    I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy<br> is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to<br> understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.<br>
    
    Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of<br> 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.<br>
    
    Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.

    <h3>Gagan GR</h3>
    <p>After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming<br> skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now, I<br> am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS<br> in parallel.<br>

        Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving<br> skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the<br> recorded videos. They also provide recorded videos of<br> frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.<br>
        
        I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of<br> Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.<br>
        
        Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.</p>

            Enrolling at TAP Academy Institute has been one of the best decisions for<br> my educational and professional growth. The institute offers a holistic<br> learning environment that caters to various aspects of my development as a<br> student and aspiring professional.<br>
            
            The teachers at TAP Academy are incredibly knowledgeable and always<br> willing to help. Their dedication to student success is evident in the<br> personalized attention they provide. Whenever I faced challenges, I knew I <br>could rely on my instructors to offer guidance and support, making the<br> learning process smoother and more enjoyable.<br>
            
            One of the standout features of TAP Academy is the TAI platform, dedicated<br> to coding practice. This platform has been instrumental in enhancing my<br> programming skills. LMS at TAP Academy is another great asset. It<br> centralizes all learning materials, assignments, and progress tracking in one<br> place. The dedicated job portal connects students with potential employers,<br> offering a direct pathway to internships and job placements. Through this<br> portal, I have had the opportunity to apply my skills in a professional<br> setting, which has been crucial for my career development.

            <h3>Varshaa M</h3>
            <p>I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my<br> experience with Tap Academy. They visited our college in Tamil<br> Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch, offering a free<br> course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other<br> academies, Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers,<br> who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner,<br> start from scratch, making it easy for beginners to understand,<br> and provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS<br> concepts, highly valuable for placement opportunities. I'm<br> grateful to have been selected by Avasoft with the role of <br>Trainee Engineer with a package of 5 LPA through college<br> placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's<br> incredible teaching, as I used the same approach  taught me<br> during them mock interview process. Additionally, Tap Academy <br>offers comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS<br> platform with daily class recordings, a TAl platform for practicing<br> daily programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly<br> mock assessments and Interviews, boosting placement<br> confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on logical thinking.
